# gfg-practice
Practice geeks for geeks problems.
All problems mention URL of the problem taken, most from 
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/
  
As much possible, problems have some tests performed and the test cases are checked with the <problem-name>.txt filename.

Ideal way to run is mentioned on the coding file itself.
